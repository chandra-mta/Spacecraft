This repository contains spacecraft related scripts

ACA
---
ACA/Slot Trending: magnitude and positional error trends for fiducial lights and guide stars on various time scales.

ACIS Corner Pixel Trends
------------------------
This set of scripts show plots of average corner pixel centroid slope and mean for ACIS observations. Separate plots are shown for FAINT MODE (3X3) and VFAINT MODE (5X5) observations.

ACIS Radiation Correlations 
---------------------------
This set of scripts creates ACIS radiation related plots.   --- RETIRED


ACIS Rejected Event
-------------------
Create plots of stat1 quantities, showing on-board rejected events.
The average EVTSENT, DROP_AMP, DROP_GRD, and THR_PIX obtained from L1 acis*stat1.fits
files are plotted for each observation. CTI observations are plotted separately
from regular science observations.


Dump (RDB Data Filtering)
-------------------------
This directory holds scripts which extract OTG and CCDM related data from dump data (*Dump_EM_*)

Gratings Observation 
--------------------
This set of scripts create various gratings trends created from the analysis results done by HETG Analysis Kit ("HAK"). 

HRMA Focus
----------
This set of scripts create HRMA focus related plots.

IRU
---
Extract IRU gyro bias data from archive and create trend plots

MTA Deriv
---------
contains the scripts to update trending data in the directory /data/mta4/Deriv.

OTG (RDB Data Filtering)
------------------------
This set of scripts which extract OTG and CCDM related data from dump data (*Dump_EM_*)

SIM Movement Trending
---------------------
this set of scripts related to creation of SIM movement plots in /data/mta_www/mta_sim/

SIM Temperature
----------------
This set of scripts collect sim translation/temperature data and creates trend plots.
